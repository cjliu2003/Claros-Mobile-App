# Welcome, Claros Developer, to the Claros Working repository!

Claros is a betting market analytics platform. Claros takes the form of a mobile application built with React Native. We intend to provide users with information which is neccessary and sufficient to improve betting decisions.

In all probability, if you are reading this message you are a member of the Claros development team. If it is your first time reading this, welcome to the team. We are thrilled to have you on board.

Before making any changes to the codebase, please ensure that you have received review from the founding team. This is to ensure that any changes are properly tested, do not introduce any unintended bugs or issues, and are in full alignment with the founding intent of Claros.

We welcome all ideas and suggestions for improving Claros. Feel free to open an issue or pull request with your ideas.
