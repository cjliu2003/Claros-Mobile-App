# Welcome to the Claros repository!

Claros is a sports betting tool mobile app built with React Native. Our goal is to provide users with a convenient and easy-to-use platform for placing bets on their favorite sports events.

Before making any changes to the codebase, please ensure that you have received review from the founding team. This is to ensure that any changes are properly tested, do not introduce any unintended bugs or issues, and are in full alignment with the company goals.

We welcome all ideas and suggestions for improving Claros. Feel free to open an issue or pull request with your ideas.
